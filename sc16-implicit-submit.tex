\section*{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Climate apps use HE-VI model 3D+1D. Also a pattern for 2D+1D and 3D+0D chemistry
\item Results demonstrate importance of ``batching'' solves, MLK doesn't do
\item Cache coherency is important: IMEX RK accum, tiling
\item Explicit part is HO stencil op, memory b/w bound (w/ ghost cells)
\item Implicit part is non-linear solver: App requires different matrix at each i,j index 
\item Results in repeated vertical sparse banded solve
\item Solve (tridiag, banded, dense) should vectorize on i (unit stride), tiled in pencils
\item Considerations for vector alignment, tiling, and memory
\item Performance results, scaling, comparison, by platform / parameter
\item Future work: communication hiding, load imbalance, IMEX
\end{itemize}
(Bryce's email comments) Looking over the outline:
\\
It's crucial that we clearly identify the optimizations that we
believe are novel/high-impact, vs the optimizations that are
well-known to the community (even if they were not well known to us).
For example, on the outline, we have listed "IMEX RK accum, tiling".
Do we want to present the accumulation optimizations which removed
unnecessary temporaries from the time integrator? Do we feel that
optimization is novel, or is that just a common-sense thing that only
affected us because of the Chombo programming model? Likewise, do we
want to present tiling as a focal point in this paper? Tiling is a
well-known technique; we certainly can't claim tiling in general as
novel work. Is some part of our tiling approach novel? (how about
parallelizing the tile loop - is that fairly novel? I know Sam does
this in HPGMG, but is this a widely used technique?)
\\
We would be well served by applying the scientific method at this juncture:
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Question: What concrete research question(s) are we answering?
\begin{itemize}
\item Prior research indicates that HE-VI methods show promise as a
scalable approach to solving global climate problems on cubed sphere
geometries because <explanation> [cite prior studies]. How do we
implement HE-VI methods which perform well on cache-coherent SIMD
architectures?
\item When solving a problem with a high horizontal-vertical aspect ratio
(e.g. the horizontal extents are much greater than the vertical
extents) with HE-VI methods, it is necessary to perform a large number
of small vertical implicit solves (<give examples of matrix sizes>
[citation]) which are independent of each other. <explain the type of
solves in the climate dycore - e.g. non-linear but nearly banded>
[citation]. How can we efficiently solve large quantities of small
non-linear bandedish/banded/tridiagonal matrices on cache-coherent
SIMD architectures?
\end{itemize}
\item Hypothesis: What theories did we come up with that would answer our
research question(s)?
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal memory access patterns, management of working set sizes
(e.g. staying in cache) and efficient use of vector units are
necessary to achieve good performance on cache-coherent SIMD
architectures.
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal memory access patterns: moving through memory in unit
stride, controlling the number of streams.
\item Management of working set sizes: tiling, reducing size of
temporaries/localizing temporaries (thread-local or otherwise)
\item Efficient use of vector units: moving through memory in unit
stride, controlling memory alignment, controlling array strides,
annotation-assisted autovectorization
\item TODO: List of individual, concrete optimizations from above.
\end{itemize}
\item Mainstream linear algebra libraries (<examples> [citation]) are not
well-suited for solving large quantities of small non-linear
bandedish/banded/tridiagonal matrices on cache-coherent SIMD
architectures because <expalanation> [cite prior studies if possible].
\end{itemize}


\item Prediction: If our hypotheses are true, what results can we expect to
see? \\
$\rightarrow$ TODO: What performance characteristics should we see with and
without each of the concrete optimizations from our hypothesis above?

\item Experiment: Investigate the predictions we've made. \\
$\rightarrow$ TODO: Methodology for benchmarking the optimizations identified
above and measuring the performance characteristics we're interested
in.

\item Analysis: What were the results of our experiments?
\end{itemize}
